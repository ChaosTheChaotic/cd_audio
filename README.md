# cd_audio

A rust library which contains utilities for audio CDs. Most of the code is segments copied out of a test script. Not the most robust thing ever.
This is NOT on crates.io because I aint filling out that long ahh checklist for a simple crate I made for one app. To add to a rust project, add the following to Cargo.toml
```toml
cd_audio = { git = "https://github.com/ChaosTheChaotic/cd_audio.git" }
```
